# PotatoesH3VRLib
A library for Potatoes' shtuff in H3VR.

This is a small repository that I've used in my H3VR mods.

DLLs required:
Assembly-CSharp.dll (from h3vr)
Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll (from h3vr)
UnityEngine.dll
BepInEx.dll

The only mod that currently use this is Potatoes' Compiled Custom Guns.
