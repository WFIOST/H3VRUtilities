# H3VR Utilities

H3VR Utilities is a collection of scripts which allows for extension of your H3VR custom items, making them even more cool than they once were.

## Usage

To use the scripts in this repository, first [download this UnityPackage from the Releases](potatoes.do.this.or.your.fired/pls.UnityPackage), and open your Unity Project. Make sure you have all of the stubbed H3VR scripts, and then open the UnityPackage. There should be a new window in Unity, asking you to import in all of the scripts from the H3VR Utilities UnityPackage, press import all. <!--TODO: Add the latest release> 

Now just select an object, and press add component and search for [one of the H3VR Utilities scripts](tbd.TODO) to make your custom items better than before! <!--TODO: Add the utils sript list thing>
